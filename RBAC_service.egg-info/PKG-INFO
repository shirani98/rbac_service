Django Role-Based Permissions API
=================================

This project implements a powerful and flexible Role-Based Access
Control (RBAC) system, providing granular permissions management down to
individual URLs or model-based permissions. Designed to integrate
seamlessly with Django’s class-based views and viewsets, it offers a
high level of control to administrators for securing access to API
endpoints.

Features
--------

-  Assign permissions based on models or specific URL paths.
-  Prioritize URL-based permissions over model permissions for
   fine-grained access control.
-  Easily applicable to API views or viewsets via ``permission_classes``
   and ``permission_queryset``.

Permission Types
----------------

Administrators can set permissions within the Django admin panel. There
are two ways to set permissions:

1. URL-Based Permissions: URL permissions have higher priority and can
   override model permissions. They allow you to restrict access to
   specific endpoints without relying on linked models. To use them,
   make sure to set up the url_path field when creating permission
   records.

2. Model-Based Permissions: When more general control is needed, model
   permissions can be applied. After creating permissions in the admin
   panel, define permission_classes and permission_queryset with the
   corresponding ORM class in your views.

Getting Started
---------------

Start by cloning this repository into your Django project and include
the required files.

Admin Interface:
Use the Django admin to configure permissions for specific URL paths or
models. To define permissions for a particular view, create an instance
of the Permission model with the desired URL or model settings.

Configuration codes
To enforce permissions in your API views or viewsets, define the
``permission_classes`` and ``permission_queryset``. Here’s an example on
how to apply permissions in a sample API view and viewset:
